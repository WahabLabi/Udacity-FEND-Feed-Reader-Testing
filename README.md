# Feed Reader - Unit Testing with Jasmine

This repository consists of a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

The main purpose of this project was to conduct Jasmine tests on the (pre-existing) application to ensure that it functions properly. These tests can be seen in the [feedreader.js](frontend-nanodegree-feedreader-master/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js) file. If you wish to see all of the project files then please clone or download this repository.

Skills developed:

* [x] Jasmine testing:
   * [x] Testing DOM manipulation
   * [x] Asynchronous testing

This was the fourth project for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][1] at [Udacity][2]. Udacity' lessons, supporting material, code reviews and feedback were invaluable.
