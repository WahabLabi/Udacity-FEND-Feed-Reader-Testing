# Feed Reader Testing

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and was one of my projects for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][1] at [Udacity][2].

The main purpose of this project was to conduct Jasmine tests on the (pre-existing) application to ensure that it functions properly. These tests can be seen in the [feedreader.js](frontend-nanodegree-feedreader-master/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js) file.

In order to view the application please clone or download the repo and then open the index.html file.
